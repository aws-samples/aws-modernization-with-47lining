# Energy Data Insights 

## Introduction to Energy Data Insights
Energy Data Insights (EDI) on AWS streamlines your upstream energy data leveraging the OSDUÂ® Data Platform, enhancing data visibility and accessibility. OSDU is an open-source data platform that uses standardized energy data schemas, open API technology, and a robust environment to ensure all energy workflows are seamless. EDI accelerates that process by aggregating data in one location and providing advanced cloud capabilities with high-performance computing, machine learning, and generative AI that help you uncover previously invisible subsurface insights and drive new ways of interacting with data.. <br>

## Benefits

### Accelerated Insights
Leverage proprietary AWS machine learning and generative AI capabilities to analyze vast historical data sets from geological surveys and past drilling expeditions. 

### Maximize Performance
Achieve unparalleled precision in integrated asset management, consolidating production, reservoir, and financial data for a holistic asset view. Improvements in reserve estimates can be compounded by the ability of high performance computing (HPC) to rapidly model complex scenarios and predict asset performance.

### Improve Efficiency
Optimize the reliability and security of the AWS Cloud infrastructure with cost-effective data storage and cloud-based technologies that are embedded in your OSDU Data Platform.
